# Movie Time!

## Description

For this weekend project I wanted to make a full-stack web application that would use conjoined database tables to store multiple genres for each movie. This app uses React with Redux and Sagas to handle asynchronous commands to and from the server and database. The main page is a gallery showing Titles and Poster images of each movie in a card format.
There is an icon button on the card the user can click on to go to a Details page for that particular movie and view the description as well as a list of genres for the movie.
There is also an Add Movie page with a form that lets the user add new movies to the database along with a genre.

## Start Up

- Fork and Clone this repo to your local machine
- use the instructions in the `data.sql` file to set up the database on your machine
